                        MegaVideo has been in business for 20 years now since 1997. It started as a family own business
                        and we have chosen to keep that local interaction with our community in order to provide the best quality 
                        customer service to all. For a local business, we have a large variety of video entertainment. We not only carry 
                        movies in DVD but also in Blu-ray. The largest variety. <br>
                        
                        We are located just 15 minutes South of Fresno. We strive to provide the best business in
                        video entertainment. Our collections of movies includes from classical popular movies from back in the old days
                        to the current ones coming out everyday. We update our selections bi-weekly making sure we have all new releases
